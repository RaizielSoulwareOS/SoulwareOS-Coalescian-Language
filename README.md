# SoulwareOS

**Early-stage, open-source experiment in mapping and evolving meaning, systems, and relationships at every scale.**

---

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This project is just getting started!  
Right now, things are rough, incomplete, and subject to major change.  
I’m sharing early to invite feedback, ideas, and maybe a little help.

## 🧬 Language Preview

SoulwareOS uses a simple, flexible language for mapping systems and relationships. Here’s a taste:

```
## Primitives (what exists)

1. **Entity** `E` — any system/agent/process.
2. **State** `σ(E)` — the current configuration of an entity.
3. **Relation** `ρ(Ei,Ej)` — a channel by which change can propagate.
4. **Flow** `φ` — propagation of change across relations over a cut of the system.
```

*(This is a rough preview—language details will evolve! See [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) for more.)*
