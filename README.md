# SoulwareOS

**Early-stage, open-source experiment in mapping and evolving meaning, systems, and relationships at every scale.**

---

## 🚧 Work In Progress

This project is just getting started!  
Right now, things are rough, incomplete, and subject to major change.  
I’m sharing early to invite feedback, ideas, and maybe a little help.

## 🧬 Language Preview

SoulwareOS uses a simple, flexible language for mapping systems and relationships. Here’s a taste:

```
entity: Self
goal: "Understand and evolve meaning"
relationship: Self <-> World : "Learning, adapting, reflecting"
process: [perceive, interpret, respond]
```

*(This is a rough preview—language details will evolve! See [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) for more.)*
