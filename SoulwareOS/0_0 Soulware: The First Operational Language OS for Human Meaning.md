# Soulware: The First Operational Language OS for Human Meaning

## Part I: The K4 Universal Kernel

(This is the foundational layer. See K4_Universal_Kernel_v1.0.md for full details.)

## Part II: The Six Pillars of the Operating System

### Pillar 1: Somantic Layer - The First Data Channel

The body provides a real-time data feed on the system's state. It is the primary sensor for the K4 primitives.

- **Somantic Vector**: A multi-dimensional analysis of state, including Arousal, Valence, Constriction/Expansion (Axiom A3: Boundedness), and Rhythm.
- **Somantics Lexicon**: A table of 25 core patterns (e.g., "Chest Tightness," "Slow Nods") directly linked to K4 roots, operators, and guardrails.

### Pillar 2: State Types - The Nouns of Experience

These are recognizable, nameable conditions that a system can be in, derived from the interplay of K4 primitives and axioms.

- **Potential & Invitation**: `Seed`, `Call`
- **Tension & Constraint**: `Ache`, `Friction`, `Boundary` (Axiom A3)
- **Flow & Blockage**: `Current`, `Stall`
- **Cohesion & Capital**: `Coherence`, `Trust-Reserve`
- **Transition & Change**: `Threshold`, `Phase-Shift`, `Growth`, `Dissolution` (Axiom A1)

### Pillar 3: Operators - The Verbs of Action

These are the functional tools for navigating states. They are the human-facing implementation of K4's four core operators.

- **Integrity (Self-Checks)**: `presence.check()`, `energy.scan()`
- **Readiness & Reality (Mutual Gates)**: `presence.ping()`, `consent.check()`
- **Framing & Branching**: `dive.invite()`, `thread.cut()`, `pause.offer()`
- **Repair & Closure**: `rupture.name()`, `impact.check()`, `trust.reseed()`

### Pillar 4: Descriptors & Syntax - The Grammar & Style

- **Descriptors**: Modifiers that adjust the style of an operator without changing its core function (e.g., `slow`, `playful`, `systemic`).
- **Syntax Keys**: The logic gates and combinators for building operator sequences (e.g., `if`, `then`, `or`, `.self`, `.other`).

### Pillar 5: The Safety Pillar - Guardrails & Immune System

A robust system for ethical use, rooted in K4's axioms.

- **Guardrails**: Non-negotiable rules like `Consent Before Impact` and `Non-Coercion by Design`.
- **Immune System**: A dynamic defense against "meaning cancers" (e.g., gaslighting, propaganda) that uses meta-operators to detect, neutralize, and learn from threats.

### Pillar 6: Meta-Operators - The Tools for Evolution

These are the "OS command line" for the language itself, enabling it to evolve without corruption.

- **Versioning**: `snapshot.freeze()`, `language.fork()`, `language.merge()`
- **Meaning Integrity**: `drift.scan()`, `term.define()`, `concept.anchor()`
- **System Governance**: `guardrail.audit()`, `meta.reflect()`

## The Full Rosetta Grid

(This would be a table detailing the crosswalk from Somantic Cue → Inevitability → Constant → State Type → Operator → Mythic Frame. It is the central piece of the framework, tying all pillars together.)
