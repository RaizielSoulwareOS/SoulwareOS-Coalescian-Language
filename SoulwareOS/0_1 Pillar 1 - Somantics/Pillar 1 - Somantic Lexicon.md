# Somantics Null States Table (K4 Integrated)

## 1. No tension / low activation

- **K4 Root:** Stable State (σ) with high Coherence (κ), low Potential (Π).
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `presence.check(self)`: "Am I feeling safe and rested, or just disconnected?" 
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `presence.ping`: "I'm noticing calm between us. How are you feeling?"
- **Guardrail:** Absence is not consent. Calm ≠ agreement/readiness.

---

## 2. No noticeable breath shift

- **K4 Root:** Steady-state Relation (ρ) where the Flow (φ) is not creating internal perturbations.
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `stance.align`: "Is my breathing steady because I'm aligned, or because I'm holding back?"
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `intent.verify`: "It feels like we're on the same page. Does that feel true for you?"
- **Guardrail:** Verify alignment explicitly. Do not assume a lack of reaction means agreement.

---

## 3. No change in heart rate

- **K4 Root:** Relation (ρ) has low coupling; feedback in the Flow (φ) is insufficient to alter the State (σ).
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `energy.scan`: "Am I feeling calm, or am I just not connecting with this topic?"
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `mirror.throw`: "I'm not getting a strong read. Where are you at with this?"
- **Guardrail:** Do not force emotional engagement. A low-arousal state is valid and must be respected.

---

## 4. No urge to move / stillness

- **K4 Root:** The Entity is not near a threshold for an Event (Δ); the system is stable within Axiom A3 (Boundedness).
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `self.trace`: "Is this a state of deep focus I should hold, or am I stuck?"
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `pause.offer`: "Should we hold this space for a moment, or are you ready to move on?"
- **Guardrail:** Stillness requires consent to change. Before shifting from a still state, use `pause.offer` to verify readiness.

---

## 5. No facial movement / blankness

- **K4 Root:** The Entity is not emitting a clear signal in its Flow (φ), possibly to conserve Capacity (C).
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `truth.touch`: "Am I resting, or am I masking my true state?"
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `share.bridge`: "I can't read your expression. Can you share what's happening for you?"
- **Guardrail:** Invite, don't demand. A blank expression is a boundary. You can invite sharing, but you cannot demand to know what is behind it.

---

## 6. No sensory variance

- **K4 Root:** The Entity is restricting sensory Flow (φ), either due to external Entropy or a deep internal integrate(S) process.
- **Inner Operators:**
  - `energy.scan`: "Am I in a healthy flow state, or am I shutting down from overwhelm?"
- **Outer Operators:**
  - `consent.check`: "It seems like you're really focused. Do you need some space right now?"
- **Guardrail:** Protect the state. Whether it's a flow state or a shutdown, the correct action is to reduce external input and offer space.
