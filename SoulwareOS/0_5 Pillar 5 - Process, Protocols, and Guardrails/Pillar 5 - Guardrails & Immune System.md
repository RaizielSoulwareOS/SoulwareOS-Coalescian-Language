## Part 1: The Guardrails (The Core Rules)

The Guardrails are the ethical bedrock of SoulwareOS—not optional etiquette, but enforced gates built into the syntax and logic of the system's Operators.

**1. Presence First**  
_No meaningful interaction can proceed without mutual presence._

- **Rule:** Always run `presence.check(self)` and `presence.ping(other)` before engaging in any operator that requires depth or vulnerability.
- **K4 Root:** Ensures that a Relation (ρ) is active and capable of carrying a coherent Flow (φ) before any action is taken.

**2. Consent Before Impact**  
_All actions that cross a boundary or increase vulnerability must be consensual._

- **Rule:** `consent.check()` is a mandatory gate before operators like `dive.invite`, `risk.share`, or `truth.mirror`.
- **K4 Root:** Respects Axiom A3 (Boundedness), acknowledging each Entity’s sovereign right to control the Flow it receives.

**3. Non-Coercion by Design**  
_The system must always provide a choice._

- **Rule:** All invitations must have a clean, no-fault exit path. Operators like `pause.offer` and `thread.cut` must always be available.
- **K4 Root:** Prevents one Entity from using a transform operator to force a change in another’s State (σ) against their will.

**4. Acknowledge Capacity**  
_Interactions must respect the available energy and resources of all participants._

- **Rule:** Use `energy.scan()` to gauge your own and others’ capacity before initiating a high-load process.
- **K4 Root:** Honors the Derived Quantity of Capacity (C), preventing system overload and collapse.

**5. Repair is a Priority**  
_When a rupture occurs, the system defaults to a state of repair._

- **Rule:** A `rupture.name()` event should be immediately followed by an `impact.check()` and an offer to `repair.try`.
- **K4 Root:** Restores Coherence (κ) after a `differentiate(S)` event has introduced Entropy into a Relation (ρ).

## Part 2: The Immune System (Dynamic Defense)

The Immune System is the active, intelligent process that enforces the Guardrails and learns from "meaning cancers"—patterns of communication toxic to the health of a relationship or system.

### A Proactive Health Model (Systemic Wellness)

A healthy immune system maintains wellness, not just fights disease. Proactive "hygiene" practices keep the system resilient:

- **Relational Nutrition:** Use operators that build Trust-Reserve and Coherence (e.g., `share.bridge`, `vibe.keep`).
- **Systemic Rest:** Use `flow.pause` and `reset.point` to avoid burnout and allow integration.
- **Clarity Maintenance:** Periodically run `context.sync` and `term.define` to prevent semantic drift.

---

### The Threat Model: Identifying "Meaning Cancers"

The Immune System is trained to recognize specific toxic patterns. Here are a few common threats and their primary immune responses:

**Gaslighting**  
_An attempt to invalidate an Entity's perceived State (σ) and replace it with a false narrative._  
- **Counter:** `reality.place()`, `truth.mirror()`, `boundary.hold()`

**Coercion**  
_Using pressure to force a transform in another's State (σ) without genuine consent._  
- **Counter:** `consent.check()` (Guardrail), `thread.cut()` (escape hatch)

**Dominance Loop**  
_One Entity monopolizing the Flow (φ) in a Relation (ρ), preventing others from contributing._  
- **Counter:** `impact.check()`, `topic.pivot()`, `readiness.sync()`

**Propaganda**  
_The injection of a high-Entropy, low-Coherence Flow (φ) designed to destabilize a system._  
- **Counter:** `truth.touch()`, `scale.shift()`, `meaning.anchor()`

---

### The Immune Response Cycle

**Innate Immunity (The First Line of Defense):**  
- **Detection:** The Somantic Layer flags mismatches between words and body signals.
- **Response:** Core Guardrails (Presence, Consent) act as immediate, non-specific defense.

**Adaptive Immunity (Learning from Threats):**  
- **Detection:** Uses `pattern.spot()` and `memory.pull()` to recognize recurring toxic patterns.
- **Response:** Deploys specific Operators to neutralize the threat.
- **Memory:** Uses `insight.lock()` and `pattern.embed()` to "remember" threats and successful responses.

**Healing & Recovery:**  
After a threat is neutralized, the system enters a healing phase using Repair & Recovery operators (`rupture.name`, `impact.check`, `trust.reseed`).

---

### The Survival Protocol: Operators for Endurance

Not all threats can be confronted directly. When endurance is the only option, the Immune System supports:

**1. Conserve Energy & Reduce Surface Area**  
- `boundary.hold()`: Create a firm internal "no" to minimize engagement with toxic Flow.
- `flow.pause()`: Disengage from draining topics to conserve Capacity.
- `thread.cut(reason: "low-capacity")`: Clean disengagement to preserve energy.

**2. Maintain Internal Integrity**  
- `truth.touch()`: Self-check for personal truth as an anchor.
- `meaning.anchor()`: Connect struggle to a deeper "why."
- `self.trace()`: Map your own state to remember situations are temporary.

**3. Prepare for the Future**  
- `seed.marker()`: Save insights or opportunities for safer times.
- `energy.scan()`: Track energy reserves for small steps forward.
- `help.request(scope: "witness")`: Minimal requests for support to counter isolation.

---

### The Autoimmune Risk: Preventing Self-Attack

The Safety Pillar itself must not become rigid or weaponized. Safeguards include:

- **Generous Interpretation:** Assume good faith; use `intent.verify()` before a strong immune response.
- **frame.shift() Antidote:** Use `frame.shift()` to introduce new perspectives if the system feels dogmatic or stuck.
- **Meta-Operator Audit:** Use `meta.reflect()` to review, "Are our protocols creating health, or fear?"

## Part 3: The Rosetta Grid (The Master Reference)

This grid links the physics of the K4 Kernel to somantic cues, the dynamics they signal, state types, relevant operators, mythic frames for memory, and core guardrails for safety.

# Asynchronous Communication: Guardrails & Operators

## Purpose & Core Principles

This framework protects **clarity, consent, and pacing** in asynchronous channels where presence is fragmented and somatic cues are low-bandwidth.  
It operates on these principles:

- **Explicit Presence** over assumed attention
- **Stamped Context** over vibe-guessing
- **Consent to Depth** over sneaking escalation
- **Thread Hygiene** over drift
- **Repair by Summary** over re-litigation
- **Bounded Expectations** over open loops

---

## The Default Envelope _(A Practical Starting Point)_

To ensure clarity from the beginning, start important async messages with a simple, explicit envelope:

```text
[context.sync] Topic: <one-line topic>
[readiness.check] OK to receive now? (Y/N/Later) • Preferred window: <range>
[expectation.set] I expect to reply by <timezone/time>.
[tone.clarify] Intent: <supportive / neutral / exploratory / decision-seeking>
```

_In ultra-casual contexts, this can be collapsed:_  
`Topic X • ok to receive now? I can reply by ~Tue 5p NZT (supportive).`

---

## Key Async Operator Adaptations

These operators manage flow and state where live feedback is rare. They are shims on core verbs, not entirely new operators.

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **presence.ping(θ) → readiness.check(window, topic)** | Substitute for live presence check: “When you have bandwidth this week, are you open to X?” |
| **tone.clarify(intent)** | Explicitly reduce noise: “Intent: supportive / neutral / probing / decision” |
| **meta.state()** | Tag your own state when somatic cues aren’t available |
| **context.sync(topic, scope) → context.refresh({summary, links, decisions})** | Lead with a 3-bullet recap before proposing new moves. Scope can be `[DECIDE]`, `[INFO]`, `[BRAINSTORM]`, or `[REPAIR]`. |
| **consent.check(depth)** | “Can we go <light / medium / deep> on this thread?” |
| **mirror.throw(content) → mirror.throw(content, snapshot=ref)** | Always include the exact sentence or issue link you’re reflecting |
| **impact.check() → impact.check(form=one-question)** | “How did this land on your side?” |
| **repair.try(summary)** | Recap thread in bullet points and ask for corrections |
| **expectation.set(eta, channel)** | Declare your response timeline: “Reply by <time> on <channel>” |
| **seed.marker(when/how)** | Park a topic and set a clear re-entry point |
| **thread.cut(reason) → exit.clean(reason, marker)** | Cleanly close a thread with an explicit marker |
| **close.loop(type)** | Formally close a thread: “Closed (soft). Re-enter if <condition>” |

---

## The 10 Async Guardrails

> **In the absence of somatic cues, these guardrails keep async safe and resilient:**

1. **Latency Guardrail:**  
   If a thread’s context is older than e.g. 48h, require `context.refresh()` before any depth move.
2. **Consent-in-Absence:**  
   Assume low presence. Replace live pings with `readiness.check(window, topic)`. If no explicit "yes" is received, default to Baseline Profile.
3. **Tone Disambiguation:**  
   Require `tone.clarify(tag)` for critique, requests, or repairs.
4. **Thread Integrity:**  
   One topic per thread. New topics = new threads.
5. **Snapshot Semantics:**  
   Use a `context.snapshot()` (short quote or link) before `mirror.throw()` or `truth.drop()`.
6. **Rate & Batch:**  
   Don’t flood a channel. Rate limit and bundle multiple points in one reply.
7. **Repair Priority:**  
   Repairs (`repair.try()`) must be opt-in. Only run if `readiness.check()` passes; else, use `seed.marker(when)`.
8. **Privacy/Scope:**  
   Run `scope.set(audience, visibility)`. Moving from private to group requires `consent.check()`.
9. **Escalation Rule:**  
   If two repair attempts fail or ambiguity increases, propose `channel.upgrade(voice/video)`.
10. **Ending Cleanly:**  
    Prevent “zombie threads” with `close.loop(soft|hard)` and a marker for why/when to reopen.

## Practical Tools & Templates

### Minimal Day-One Async Kit

- `readiness.check(window)`
- `context.sync(topic, scope)`
- `consent.check(depth)`
- `expectation.set(eta, channel)`
- `repair.try(summary)`

---

### Templates

#### 1) Kickoff (Decision)

```text
[context.sync] Topic: Vendor shortlist • Scope: DECIDE
[readiness.check] OK to receive today 2–6p NZT?
[expectation.set] I’ll reply by Wed 10a NZT.
[tone.clarify] Intent: neutral, decision-seeking.

Question: prefer A or B?
```

#### 2) Repair (After Misfire)

```text
[repair.try] Quick recap of the thread so far.
[mirror.throw] My read: the timing felt tight + my note landed sharp. True?
[impact.check] How did this land?
[consent.check] OK to go medium depth to resolve this async?
```

#### 3) Close Cleanly

```text
[thread.cut] Closing this thread: decision was made in the meeting.
[close.loop] Closed (soft).
[seed.marker] If requirements change, we can reopen this.
```

---

## Handling Failures

- **Ghosting:**  
  If a response is past its expected time, send one `seed.marker` and then stop.
- **Scope Creep:**  
  Reply with `context.sync` and ask to retag or split the thread.
- **Wall-of-Text:**  
  Use `repair.try(summary)` to distill the message into key points before responding.
- **Ambiguous Tone:**  
  Use `tone.clarify` to state your own intent and gently invite theirs.
