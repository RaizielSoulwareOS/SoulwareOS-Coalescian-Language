# Part 1: Descriptors (The Style of Action)

**Descriptors** are modifiers that change the _feel_ of an operator without changing its core function.  
They are driven by the **Somatic Layer**â€”the body's state informs the appropriate style. Think of these as sliders you can adjust to match the context.

---

### Descriptor Types

- **Tempo:**  
  Controls the pacing and temporal frame of an action.  
  _Examples: `slow`, `steady`, `brisk`, `urgent`, `pulsed`_

- **Scope:**  
  Sets the scale at which the operator is being applied.  
  _Examples: `personal`, `relational`, `systemic`, `universal`_

- **Tone:**  
  The emotional or affective color of the operator.  
  _Examples: `warm`, `clinical`, `playful`, `direct`, `reverent`_

- **Polarity:**  
  Chooses the directional vector of the change.  
  _Examples: `inviting`, `challenging`, `holding`, `releasing`, `neutral`_

- **Intensity:**  
  Sets the strength or magnitude of the operator.  
  _Examples: `light`, `medium`, `deep`, `total`_

- **Focus:**  
  Filters the primary channel of communication.  
  _Examples: `emotional`, `logical`, `sensory`, `symbolic`_

### Example in Practice

The operator `truth.drop()` can be modified in many ways:

- `truth.drop(tone: gentle, scope: personal)`  
  _A soft, vulnerable sharing._

- `truth.drop(tone: direct, scope: systemic)`  
  _A firm statement about a group dynamic._

# Part 2: Syntax Keys (The Logic of Action)

**Syntax Keys** are the structural glue of SoulwareOS.  
They are the logical combinators that allow you to build simple operators into complex, meaningful "sentences."  
They make the language programmable and allow for clear, non-coercive branching.

---

### Syntax Key Types

- **Conditional Keys:**  
  Define logic gates for when an operator should run.  
  _Examples: `if`, `when`, `unless`_  
  **Example:**  
  `repair.try if readiness.sync()`  
  _(Only attempt repair if both parties are ready.)_

- **Sequencing Keys:**  
  Set the order of operations.  
  _Examples: `then`, `after`, `before`_  
  **Example:**  
  `presence.ping() then dive.invite(depth)`  
  _(Check for presence before inviting to go deeper.)_

- **Branching Keys:**  
  Offer alternatives without coercion, creating choice.  
  _Examples: `or`, `else`, `maybe`_  
  **Example:**  
  `seed.marker() or close.loop(soft)`  
  _(We can either mark this to return to later, or we can close the conversation softly.)_

- **Loop Keys:**  
  Sustain or repeat an action until a condition changes.  
  _Examples: `while`, `until`, `again`_  
  **Example:**  
  `reflect.send while trust.hold()`  
  _(Continue to reflect and listen as long as the state of trust is maintained.)_

- **Targeting Keys:**  
  Direct the scope of an operator to a specific Entity.  
  _Examples: `.self`, `.other`, `.group`_  
  **Example:**  
  `energy.scan.self before presence.ping.other`  
  _(Scan my own energy before I check on theirs.)_

By combining these keys, users can construct sophisticated and precise conversational "scripts" that are both effective and safe.
