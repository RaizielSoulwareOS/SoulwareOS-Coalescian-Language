## Part 1: The Guardrails (The Core Rules)

The Guardrails are the ethical bedrock of SoulwareOS—not optional etiquette, but enforced gates built into the syntax and logic of the system's Operators.

**1. Presence First**  
_No meaningful interaction can proceed without mutual presence._

- **Rule:** Always run `presence.check(self)` and `presence.ping(other)` before engaging in any operator that requires depth or vulnerability.
- **K4 Root:** Ensures that a Relation (ρ) is active and capable of carrying a coherent Flow (φ) before any action is taken.

**2. Consent Before Impact**  
_All actions that cross a boundary or increase vulnerability must be consensual._

- **Rule:** `consent.check()` is a mandatory gate before operators like `dive.invite`, `risk.share`, or `truth.mirror`.
- **K4 Root:** Respects Axiom A3 (Boundedness), acknowledging each Entity’s sovereign right to control the Flow it receives.

**3. Non-Coercion by Design**  
_The system must always provide a choice._

- **Rule:** All invitations must have a clean, no-fault exit path. Operators like `pause.offer` and `thread.cut` must always be available.
- **K4 Root:** Prevents one Entity from using a transform operator to force a change in another’s State (σ) against their will.

**4. Acknowledge Capacity**  
_Interactions must respect the available energy and resources of all participants._

- **Rule:** Use `energy.scan()` to gauge your own and others’ capacity before initiating a high-load process.
- **K4 Root:** Honors the Derived Quantity of Capacity (C), preventing system overload and collapse.

**5. Repair is a Priority**  
_When a rupture occurs, the system defaults to a state of repair._

- **Rule:** A `rupture.name()` event should be immediately followed by an `impact.check()` and an offer to `repair.try`.
- **K4 Root:** Restores Coherence (κ) after a `differentiate(S)` event has introduced Entropy into a Relation (ρ).

## Part 2: The Immune System (Dynamic Defense)

The Immune System is the active, intelligent process that enforces the Guardrails and learns from "meaning cancers"—patterns of communication toxic to the health of a relationship or system.

### A Proactive Health Model (Systemic Wellness)

A healthy immune system maintains wellness, not just fights disease. Proactive "hygiene" practices keep the system resilient:

- **Relational Nutrition:** Use operators that build Trust-Reserve and Coherence (e.g., `share.bridge`, `vibe.keep`).
- **Systemic Rest:** Use `flow.pause` and `reset.point` to avoid burnout and allow integration.
- **Clarity Maintenance:** Periodically run `context.sync` and `term.define` to prevent semantic drift.

---

### The Threat Model: Identifying "Meaning Cancers"

The Immune System is trained to recognize specific toxic patterns. Here are a few common threats and their primary immune responses:

**Gaslighting**  
_An attempt to invalidate an Entity's perceived State (σ) and replace it with a false narrative._  
- **Counter:** `reality.place()`, `truth.mirror()`, `boundary.hold()`

**Coercion**  
_Using pressure to force a transform in another's State (σ) without genuine consent._  
- **Counter:** `consent.check()` (Guardrail), `thread.cut()` (escape hatch)

**Dominance Loop**  
_One Entity monopolizing the Flow (φ) in a Relation (ρ), preventing others from contributing._  
- **Counter:** `impact.check()`, `topic.pivot()`, `readiness.sync()`

**Propaganda**  
_The injection of a high-Entropy, low-Coherence Flow (φ) designed to destabilize a system._  
- **Counter:** `truth.touch()`, `scale.shift()`, `meaning.anchor()`

---

### The Immune Response Cycle

**Innate Immunity (The First Line of Defense):**  
- **Detection:** The Somantic Layer flags mismatches between words and body signals.
- **Response:** Core Guardrails (Presence, Consent) act as immediate, non-specific defense.

**Adaptive Immunity (Learning from Threats):**  
- **Detection:** Uses `pattern.spot()` and `memory.pull()` to recognize recurring toxic patterns.
- **Response:** Deploys specific Operators to neutralize the threat.
- **Memory:** Uses `insight.lock()` and `pattern.embed()` to "remember" threats and successful responses.

**Healing & Recovery:**  
After a threat is neutralized, the system enters a healing phase using Repair & Recovery operators (`rupture.name`, `impact.check`, `trust.reseed`).

---

### The Survival Protocol: Operators for Endurance

Not all threats can be confronted directly. When endurance is the only option, the Immune System supports:

**1. Conserve Energy & Reduce Surface Area**  
- `boundary.hold()`: Create a firm internal "no" to minimize engagement with toxic Flow.
- `flow.pause()`: Disengage from draining topics to conserve Capacity.
- `thread.cut(reason: "low-capacity")`: Clean disengagement to preserve energy.

**2. Maintain Internal Integrity**  
- `truth.touch()`: Self-check for personal truth as an anchor.
- `meaning.anchor()`: Connect struggle to a deeper "why."
- `self.trace()`: Map your own state to remember situations are temporary.

**3. Prepare for the Future**  
- `seed.marker()`: Save insights or opportunities for safer times.
- `energy.scan()`: Track energy reserves for small steps forward.
- `help.request(scope: "witness")`: Minimal requests for support to counter isolation.

---

### The Autoimmune Risk: Preventing Self-Attack

The Safety Pillar itself must not become rigid or weaponized. Safeguards include:

- **Generous Interpretation:** Assume good faith; use `intent.verify()` before a strong immune response.
- **frame.shift() Antidote:** Use `frame.shift()` to introduce new perspectives if the system feels dogmatic or stuck.
- **Meta-Operator Audit:** Use `meta.reflect()` to review, "Are our protocols creating health, or fear?"

## Part 3: The Rosetta Grid (The Master Reference)
