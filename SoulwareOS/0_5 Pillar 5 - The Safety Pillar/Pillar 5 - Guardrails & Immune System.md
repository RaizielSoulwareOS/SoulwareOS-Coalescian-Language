## Part 1: The Guardrails (The Core Rules)

The Guardrails are the ethical bedrock of SoulwareOS—not optional etiquette, but enforced gates built into the syntax and logic of the system's Operators.

**1. Presence First**  
_No meaningful interaction can proceed without mutual presence._

- **Rule:** Always run `presence.check(self)` and `presence.ping(other)` before engaging in any operator that requires depth or vulnerability.
- **K4 Root:** Ensures that a Relation (ρ) is active and capable of carrying a coherent Flow (φ) before any action is taken.

**2. Consent Before Impact**  
_All actions that cross a boundary or increase vulnerability must be consensual._

- **Rule:** `consent.check()` is a mandatory gate before operators like `dive.invite`, `risk.share`, or `truth.mirror`.
- **K4 Root:** Respects Axiom A3 (Boundedness), acknowledging each Entity’s sovereign right to control the Flow it receives.

**3. Non-Coercion by Design**  
_The system must always provide a choice._

- **Rule:** All invitations must have a clean, no-fault exit path. Operators like `pause.offer` and `thread.cut` must always be available.
- **K4 Root:** Prevents one Entity from using a transform operator to force a change in another’s State (σ) against their will.

**4. Acknowledge Capacity**  
_Interactions must respect the available energy and resources of all participants._

- **Rule:** Use `energy.scan()` to gauge your own and others’ capacity before initiating a high-load process.
- **K4 Root:** Honors the Derived Quantity of Capacity (C), preventing system overload and collapse.

**5. Repair is a Priority**  
_When a rupture occurs, the system defaults to a state of repair._

- **Rule:** A `rupture.name()` event should be immediately followed by an `impact.check()` and an offer to `repair.try`.
- **K4 Root:** Restores Coherence (κ) after a `differentiate(S)` event has introduced Entropy into a Relation (ρ).

# Asynchronous Flows (Non-Live Communication)

These operators are designed to manage Flow and State in environments without live somatic cues.

- `readiness.check()`: A substitute for presence.ping() in text-based communication.
- `tone.clarify()`: A Transform operator to explicitly reduce Entropy (noise) and prevent misinterpretation.
- `meta.state()`: A Transform operator that allows an entity to explicitly tag its own state when somatic cues are unavailable.

## Async  — Guardrails

With the absence of somatic cues, new guardrails are needed. For example, a 

`readiness.check()` is required before a high-load `Flow`, and `tone.clarify()` is used to prevent misinterpretation that could lead to a `Rupture`. These rules ensure the system remains safe and resilient even without live feedback.

**A1. Latency Guardrail — “Stale state fails shut.”**
 If the thread’s context is older than Δ (e.g., 48h) → require `context.refresh()` before any depth move.

**A2. Consent-in-Absence — “Assume low presence.”**
 Replace live `presence.ping(θ)` with `readiness.check(window, topic)`. If no explicit yes → default to Baseline.

**A3. Tone Disambiguation — “Label intent.”**
 Require `tone.clarify(tag)` when message contains critique/request/repair (e.g., supportive / neutral / exploratory).

**A4. Thread Integrity — “One thread, one vector.”**
 Enforce `thread.bind(topic_id)`; new vectors → `topic.split(new_id)` to avoid mixed intents.

**A5. Snapshot Semantics — “Quote what you’re replying to.”**
 Use `context.snapshot(ref)` (short quoted passage or message link) before `mirror.throw()` or `truth.drop()`.

**A6. Rate & Batch — “Do not flood.”**
 Apply `rate.limit(n/hour)` and `batch.bundle()` for multi-point replies; prevents coercive pressure via volume.

**A7. Repair Priority — “Async repairs are opt-in.”**
 Only run `repair.try()` if `readiness.check()` passes; else `seed.marker(when)`; never escalate in-thread.

**A8. Privacy/Scope — “Right audience, right scope.”**
 Run `scope.set(audience, visibility)`; moving from DM → group requires `consent.check()`.

**A9. Escalation Rule — “When text is insufficient, upgrade channel.”**
 If 2 repair attempts fail or semantic variance ↑ after reply → propose `channel.upgrade(voice/video)`.

**A10. Ending Cleanly — “Prevent zombie threads.”**
 Close with `close.loop(soft|hard)` + `marker(why/when)` to avoid dangling affect.

 ## Async Operator Adaptations (small shims, not new verbs)

- **presence.ping(θ)** → `readiness.check(window, topic)`
   “When you have bandwidth this week, are you open to X?”
- **mirror.throw(content)** → `mirror.throw(content, snapshot=ref)`
   Always include the exact sentence/issue link you’re reflecting.
- **truth.drop(raw)** → `truth.drop(raw, tag=tone)`
   “(exploratory) My read: ___; check me if off.”
- **dive.invite(depth)** → `dive.invite(depth, window)`
   Offer time windows or async cadence options.
- **thread.cut(reason)** → `exit.clean(reason, marker)`
   Close with an explicit marker for where/when to resume, if at all.
- **impact.check()** (repair) → `impact.check(form=one-question)`
   Keep to a single, answerable question to reduce pressure.
- **context.sync()** → `context.refresh({summary, links, decisions})`
   Lead with a 3-bullet recap before proposing moves.
- **scope.set(range)** (meta-nav) → include `audience`, `retention`, `cc` explicitly.

## Part 2: The Immune System (Dynamic Defense)

The Immune System is the active, intelligent process that enforces the Guardrails and learns from "meaning cancers"—patterns of communication toxic to the health of a relationship or system.

### A Proactive Health Model (Systemic Wellness)

A healthy immune system maintains wellness, not just fights disease. Proactive "hygiene" practices keep the system resilient:

- **Relational Nutrition:** Use operators that build Trust-Reserve and Coherence (e.g., `share.bridge`, `vibe.keep`).
- **Systemic Rest:** Use `flow.pause` and `reset.point` to avoid burnout and allow integration.
- **Clarity Maintenance:** Periodically run `context.sync` and `term.define` to prevent semantic drift.

---

### The Threat Model: Identifying "Meaning Cancers"

The Immune System is trained to recognize specific toxic patterns. Here are a few common threats and their primary immune responses:

**Gaslighting**  
_An attempt to invalidate an Entity's perceived State (σ) and replace it with a false narrative._  
- **Counter:** `reality.place()`, `truth.mirror()`, `boundary.hold()`

**Coercion**  
_Using pressure to force a transform in another's State (σ) without genuine consent._  
- **Counter:** `consent.check()` (Guardrail), `thread.cut()` (escape hatch)

**Dominance Loop**  
_One Entity monopolizing the Flow (φ) in a Relation (ρ), preventing others from contributing._  
- **Counter:** `impact.check()`, `topic.pivot()`, `readiness.sync()`

**Propaganda**  
_The injection of a high-Entropy, low-Coherence Flow (φ) designed to destabilize a system._  
- **Counter:** `truth.touch()`, `scale.shift()`, `meaning.anchor()`

---

### The Immune Response Cycle

**Innate Immunity (The First Line of Defense):**  
- **Detection:** The Somantic Layer flags mismatches between words and body signals.
- **Response:** Core Guardrails (Presence, Consent) act as immediate, non-specific defense.

**Adaptive Immunity (Learning from Threats):**  
- **Detection:** Uses `pattern.spot()` and `memory.pull()` to recognize recurring toxic patterns.
- **Response:** Deploys specific Operators to neutralize the threat.
- **Memory:** Uses `insight.lock()` and `pattern.embed()` to "remember" threats and successful responses.

**Healing & Recovery:**  
After a threat is neutralized, the system enters a healing phase using Repair & Recovery operators (`rupture.name`, `impact.check`, `trust.reseed`).

---

### The Survival Protocol: Operators for Endurance

Not all threats can be confronted directly. When endurance is the only option, the Immune System supports:

**1. Conserve Energy & Reduce Surface Area**  
- `boundary.hold()`: Create a firm internal "no" to minimize engagement with toxic Flow.
- `flow.pause()`: Disengage from draining topics to conserve Capacity.
- `thread.cut(reason: "low-capacity")`: Clean disengagement to preserve energy.

**2. Maintain Internal Integrity**  
- `truth.touch()`: Self-check for personal truth as an anchor.
- `meaning.anchor()`: Connect struggle to a deeper "why."
- `self.trace()`: Map your own state to remember situations are temporary.

**3. Prepare for the Future**  
- `seed.marker()`: Save insights or opportunities for safer times.
- `energy.scan()`: Track energy reserves for small steps forward.
- `help.request(scope: "witness")`: Minimal requests for support to counter isolation.

---

### The Autoimmune Risk: Preventing Self-Attack

The Safety Pillar itself must not become rigid or weaponized. Safeguards include:

- **Generous Interpretation:** Assume good faith; use `intent.verify()` before a strong immune response.
- **frame.shift() Antidote:** Use `frame.shift()` to introduce new perspectives if the system feels dogmatic or stuck.
- **Meta-Operator Audit:** Use `meta.reflect()` to review, "Are our protocols creating health, or fear?"
