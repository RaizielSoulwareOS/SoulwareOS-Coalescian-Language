## Layer 6: Meta/Ops — Evolution, Integrity, and Governance

## Introduction

Layer 6 is the “machinery” of Soulware—**the systems and protocols for versioning, maintaining integrity, evolving language, preventing drift, and enabling robust group/process governance.** This layer ensures Soulware stays agile, accountable, and extensible as it grows and adapts.

------

## 1. Versioning and Change Tracking

- **Every operator, protocol, process, or state type is versioned:**
  Use simple MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH notation (e.g. `repair.try v1.2.0`)
- **Protocol scripts and profile configs track version and edit history.**
- **All changes are logged at the meta level:**
  Who, when, why, and what changed.

## Example:

```
text
protocol: stance.declare(), version: 1.1.2, last edited: 2025-09-03, by: Alice
```

------

## 2. Drift Prevention

- **Regular meta.audit() runs:**
  Scheduled or triggered review of language, profiles, protocol use—flagging ambiguity, off-model moves, or edge-case errors.
- **System checks for semantic consistency:**
  Compare terms and moves to current canonical K4 kernel; auto-flag outlier terms for review.
- **Immutable history and rollback:**
  All previous states/version are accessible—easy restoration if drift or error occurs.

------

## 3. Language & Protocol Evolution

- **Meta-evolve() mechanisms:**
  Proposal, review, and formal update processes for new words, operators, profile types, or process scripts.
- **Community peer review** and consensus thresholds control approval for canonical changes.
- **Forking and local dialect:**
  Groups can fork language/protocols for local innovation—always tagged/linked to parent for future merge potential.
- **Meta-reflect() logs:**
  Record lessons, feedback, edge cases, and repairs—helping move the whole community forward.

------

## 4. Governance & Group Operations

- **Profiles can be assigned governance tags:**
  Who can add/edit/approve changes?
- **Meta.operators for audit, arbitration, boundary setting:**
  Use `meta.reflect()`, `reflect.meta()`, `audit.protocol()` for periodic health checks.
- **Dispute and escalation protocols:**
  Clear structure for friction mapping, repair, and boundary protection.

------

## 5. Best Practices

- Always version everything—no silent changes.
- Schedule periodic meta.audit() runs (quarterly, after major changes, etc.).
- Decision logs and governance settings must be transparent—no hidden edits.
- Enable group forking and merging while maintaining compatibility.
- Prioritize reversibility and clarity in all evolutionary moves.

------

## Closing

Layer 6 is the Soulware OS’s immune system and growth engine.
**It keeps language, process, and practice clear, consistent, and open to continual upgrade—without ever losing roots or safety.**
With these mechanisms, Soulware remains adaptive, accountable, and alive at all scales.
