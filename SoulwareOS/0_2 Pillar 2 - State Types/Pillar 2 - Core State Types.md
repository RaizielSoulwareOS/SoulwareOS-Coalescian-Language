# The Core State Types

---

## A) Potential & Invitation

### 1. Seed

- **Definition:**  
  A state of latent, not-yet-activated potential. It is the quiet pull of a "could be."

- **K4 Root:**  
  A State (σ) with high Potential (Π) but low active Flow (φ). It exists within the Axiom A3 (Boundedness) of its current form but has the capacity to undergo a transform into a new state.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `future.seed()`, `spark.seed()`, `meaning.trace()`

---

### 2. Call

- **Definition:**  
  An active invitation vector pulling the system toward a new Relation or action. It's a felt magnetism or a repeated ping.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A specific, directed Flow (φ) is being emitted from one Entity to another, inviting the creation or strengthening of a Relation (ρ). It signals an approaching threshold for an Event (Δ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `dive.invite()`, `share.bridge()`, `goal.align()`

---

## B) Tension & Constraint

### 3. Ache

- **Definition:**  
  A state of dissonance or an unmet need that carries information for change. It is a hurt with a direction.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A State (σ) with high internal Entropy, often caused by an imbalanced Flow (φ) across a Relation (ρ). This state has a strong gradient pointing toward a state of higher Coherence (κ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `rupture.name()`, `truth.touch()`, `trust.reseed()`

---

### 4. Friction

- **Definition:**  
  A state of active opposition between two or more Entities or internal states. It manifests as heat in an exchange or stuck, repetitive loops.

- **K4 Root:**  
  Two or more Entities are attempting to send conflicting Flow (φ) across the same Relation (ρ), preventing the system from reaching Coherence (κ) and leading to a state of high Entropy.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `friction.name()`, `contrast.map()`, `tension.weave()`

---

### 5. Boundary

- **Definition:**  
  A protective edge or limit that defines the extent of an Entity. It is the felt sense of "this far, no further."

- **K4 Root:**  
  A direct manifestation of Axiom A3 (Boundedness). It is a state where an Entity actively resists a Flow (φ) to protect its internal State (σ) and preserve its Capacity (C).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `boundary.hold()`, `edge.mark()`, `consent.check()`

---

## C) Flow & Blockage

### 6. Current

- **Definition:**  
  A state of live, coherent exchange of meaning or energy. It is characterized by momentum and attunement.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A stable and high-volume Flow (φ) is moving across a well-defined Relation (ρ), leading to a state of high systemic Coherence (κ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `cohere.hold(ε)`, `flow.riff()`, `reflect.send()`

---

### 7. Stall

- **Definition:**  
  A state where flow has paused or flatlined, but not due to a rupture. It is characterized by low motion and circularity.

- **K4 Root:**  
  The Flow (φ) across a Relation (ρ) has dropped below a threshold, causing the system's State (σ) to stop evolving. This is often a consequence of Axiom A1 (Entropy) as Potential (Π) dissipates.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `flow.pause()`, `reset.point()`, `topic.pivot()`

---

## D) Structure & Model

### 8. Frame

- **Definition:**  
  The shared model or set of assumptions being used to interpret reality in the current moment.

- **K4 Root:**  
  The specific transform(E, f) function that an Entity is currently using to interpret incoming Flow (φ) and update its State (σ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `map.overview()`, `term.define()`, `frame.shift()`

---

### 9. Scaffold

- **Definition:**  
  A minimal, temporary structure that enables the next stage of growth. It is the state of being "good enough to move."

- **K4 Root:**  
  A State (σ) that is not yet at maximum Coherence (κ), but is stable enough to serve as a foundation for a new integrate(S) process.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `insight.lock()`, `pattern.embed()`, `memory.seed()`

---

## E) Uncertainty & Noise

### 10. Fog

- **Definition:**  
  A state of ambiguity or insufficient signal, where the path forward is unclear.

- **K4 Root:**  
  The Flow (φ) across a Relation (ρ) has a high degree of Entropy (noise), making it impossible for the receiving Entity to update its State (σ) with Coherence (κ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `intent.verify()`, `mirror.throw()`, `context.reboot()`

---

## F) Memory & Trace

### 11. Echo

- **Definition:**  
  A state where a past pattern resonates in the present moment, shaping the current reality.

- **K4 Root:**  
  The current State (σ) of the system shows a high correlation with a past state, indicating a recursive pattern in the sequence of Events (Δ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `pattern.notice()`, `memory.pull()`, `meaning.trace()`

---

### 12. Marker

- **Definition:**  
  An explicit anchor created in a Relation to allow for a clean re-entry at a future point.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A piece of information stored within a Relation (ρ) that is designed to trigger a specific transform(E, f) operator after a certain number of Events (Δ) have passed.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `seed.marker()`, `close.loop(soft)`, `plan.bind()`

---

## G) Cohesion & Capital

### 13. Coherence

- **Definition:**  
  A stable, shared shape with low internal variance. The state of being "on the same page."

- **K4 Root:**  
  A direct measure of the Derived Quantity Coherence (κ). It is a state where multiple Entities in a system have highly aligned States (σ) as a result of a successful integrate(S) process.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `cohere.hold(ε)`, `reflect.send()`, `map.overview()`

---

### 14. Trust-Reserve

- **Definition:**  
  The stored relational capital that allows a system to withstand wobble and friction.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A measure of a Relation's (ρ) resilience. It is the amount of entropic Flow (φ) the Relation can absorb before it breaks or requires a differentiate(S) event.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `trust.reseed()`, `impact.check()`, `close.loop(soft)`

---

## H) Transition & Change

### 15. Threshold

- **Definition:**  
  A state of high sensitivity, where a tiny nudge can trigger a massive change.

- **K4 Root:**  
  The system's State (σ) is near a bifurcation point, where a small change in incoming Flow (φ) will cause a large and rapid Event (Δ) of phase change.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `pace.adjust()`, `consent.check()`, `dive.invite(depth)`

---

### 16. Phase-Shift

- **Definition:**  
  The state of reorganization itself, where the fundamental rules or structure of the system are changing.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A rapid and often irreversible transform(E, f) of the system's core State (σ), moving it into a new region of its state space with different properties.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `frame.shift()`, `context.reboot()`, `insight.lock()`

---

### 17. Growth

- **Definition:**  
  A state of net expansion in the system's capacity, clarity, or coherence.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A process where the system's Coherence (κ) and Capacity (C) are consistently increasing over a sequence of Events (Δ).

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `pattern.embed()`, `share.bridge()`, `explore.co()`

---

### 18. Dissolution

- **Definition:**  
  A state where a structure breaks down, and its resources are returned to the field to feed the next cycle.

- **K4 Root:**  
  A differentiate(S) process governed by Axiom A1 (Entropy), where a system's State (σ) loses its Coherence (κ) and its component Entities are unlinked.

- **Primary Operators:**  
  `thread.cut(reason)`, `close.loop(hard)`, `memory.seed()`
