Pillar 2: State Types (The Nouns of Experience)
Introduction: Naming the Landscape
If the Somatic Layer is the raw data feed, the State Types are the first layer of interpretation. They are the "nouns" of SoulwareOSâ€”a lexicon of recognizable, nameable conditions that a system, relationship, or individual can be in.

Naming a state is a powerful act. It transforms a chaotic or confusing feeling into a known pattern with predictable properties and a clear set of tools for navigation. Each State Type is an emergent pattern that arises from the interplay of the K4 Universal Kernel's Primitives and Axioms.

This pillar provides a master list of the core State Types within SoulwareOS.
