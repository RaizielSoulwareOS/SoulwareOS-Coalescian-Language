# Soulware Language: Origins from K4 and RET

## What Is Soulware Language?

Soulware Language is a living, modular grammar for modeling and running real-world processes: from presence and emotion to complex team protocols and distributed systems.  
It is designed to be both human-readable and machine-operable, forming the expressive "API" for any protocol, interaction, or system built in the Soulware ecosystem.
