# ⏳ Temporal Module: Language of Time

## Purpose

The Temporal Module equips Soulware to operate across **past, present, and future states**.
 It treats time not as a background assumption, but as an explicit channel of relation and transformation.

- For humans → repair trauma, seed growth, align life arcs.
- For AIs → track updates, prevent infinite recursion, ensure causal integrity.
- For systems → synchronize timelines, prevent drift, manage histories.

------

## Primitives

The Temporal Module extends the K4 kernel with a minimal temporal substrate:

| Primitive          | Symbol    | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **time.now**       | σ(E)      | Anchor in current state of the entity.           |
| **time.past(n)**   | σ(E)_{−n} | Reference a discrete prior state.                |
| **time.future(n)** | σ(E)_{+n} | Reference a projected state.                     |
| **time.delta(Δ)**  | Δ         | An irreducible unit of sequence — a causal step. |

------

## Operators

Temporal operators are verbs that act on these primitives:

| Operator                      | Function                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **time.hold()**               | Stabilize coherence in the present.                          |
| **time.meet(past_state)**     | Integrate a past version of self/system into awareness.      |
| **time.seed(future_flow)**    | Mark and project intent into the future.                     |
| **time.thread(id)**           | Track continuity across Δ steps (personal or systemic narrative). |
| **time.cut(reason)**          | Intentionally close a temporal thread.                       |
| **time.loop(detect/resolve)** | Detect recursive patterns and resolve them via repair.try(). |
| **time.sync(other)**          | Align temporal arcs with another entity/system.              |

------

## Guardrails

Specialized temporal guardrails ensure safe traversal:

- **Temporal Consent** → only reference another’s past/future with consent.check().
- **Resolution Over Rumination** → repeated unresolved loops escalate to repair.try().
- **Delta Integrity** → each Δ is finite; prevents collapse into blur.
- **No Coercive Futures** → you may seed.marker for yourself, not others.

------

## Execution Profiles

Temporal operators adapt depending on execution profile:

- **Baseline** → casual continuity (threads without deep tracking).
- **Autopilot** → automated event logging (timestamps, snapshots).
- **Custom** → deliberate narrative shaping (therapy, strategic planning, high-stakes projects).

------

## Why This Matters

- Makes **time navigable** instead of implicit.
- Transforms memory from a burden into a tool.
- Turns intention-setting into an executable act.
- Prevents coercion by enforcing temporal guardrails.
- Provides a **universal substrate**: past, present, future are just different views of Δ.
