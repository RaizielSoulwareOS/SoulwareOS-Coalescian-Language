# `consent.check()` ‚áÑ `check.consent()`

## üìù 1. At a Glance

**Essence:** `consent.check()` is the **expressive act of offering a non-coercive proposal for a change in `State`, `Flow`, or `Relation`**, clearly defining its scope, depth, and reversibility. It's an invitation to braid paths. `check.consent()` is the **receptive act of filtering that incoming proposal, evaluating it against one's own `Coherence` and `Boundedness`, and then either accepting, modifying, or rejecting it**. Together, these form the **Consent Loop**‚Äîthe ethical gateway for all meaningful interaction.

**Human Translation:**

- `consent.check()` ‚Üí "Here's what I'm asking, at this depth, for this long. It's okay to say no or suggest changes."
- `check.consent()` ‚Üí "Does this align with my needs, boundaries, and path right now? I will choose freely."

**Example Syntax:**

```
// Proposing a change in discussion depth
consent.check(proposal: "dive_deeper_on_topic_X", depth: "medium", duration: "15_minutes", reversibility: "easy")
‚Üí check.consent(evaluation: "curious", next_action: "run_coherency_braid")

// A system requesting permission to access user data
consent.check(proposal: "access_location_data", scope: "app_usage", duration: "session_only", purpose: "enhance_feature_Y")
‚Üí check.consent(evaluation: "accepted", status: "permission_granted")

// Declining a proposal and offering a modification
consent.check(proposal: "work_late_tonight", impact: "personal_capacity_low")
‚Üí check.consent(evaluation: "rejected", modification_offer: "can_work_early_tomorrow")
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. System Blueprint

**Operator Type:** Expressive ‚áÑ Receptive pair.

**Inputs & Outputs:**

- **Inputs (`consent.check()`):** `proposal` (the action, change, or `Flow` being offered), `scope` (what it applies to), `depth` (level of vulnerability/engagement), `duration` (how long), `reversibility` (ease of undoing), `context` (the situation).
- **Outputs (`check.consent()`):** `evaluation` (`accepted` | `rejected` | `modified` | `curious`), `status` (permission_granted, permission_denied), `modification_offer` (if modified), `reason` (if rejected).

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Universal Family | Request ‚áÑ Receive (`link`)                                   |
| Derived Quantity | **Trust-Reserve** (Pi_trust) and **Coherence** (kappa) are primary observables. |

### K4 Primitive Interaction

This operator establishes a permissioned `link` (`œÅ`) for a proposed `Flow` (`œÜ`), managing an `Entity's` `State` (`œÉ`) and preserving `Trust-Reserve`.

- **E (Entity):** The consenting agents whose `Boundedness` and agency are being respected. Both the proposer and the recipient are `Entities` whose `States` are affected.
- **œÉ (State):** The current commitments, needs, and boundaries of an `Entity` are evaluated against the `proposal`. Acceptance `transforms()` this `State` to include the new agreement.
- **œÅ (Relation):** The **`Relation`** (`link`) between `Entities` is tested and potentially strengthened or modified by the `consent` process. It's the channel that carries the offer, response, and obligations.
- **œÜ (Flow):** The proposed change in the system (the `proposal`) constitutes a **`Flow`** that is either permitted or denied. `consent.check()` initiates this `Flow`, and `check.consent()` evaluates its `Coherence` with existing `Flows`.

**K4 Deriveds (Emergent Outcomes):**

- **Trust-Reserve (**Pi_trust**):** Directly increases when `consent` is genuinely sought and respected, demonstrating `Non-Coercion by Design` and building relational capital.
- **Œ∫ (Coherence):** Directly increases when agreements are clear and consensual, reducing `Entropy` from forced or misaligned actions and ensuring `Coherence` in the `Relation`.
- **V (Potential):** New **Potential** (`Œ†`) for collaborative `Flows` and `transformations` is unlocked when `consent` is granted, enabling aligned action.
- **Œî (Event):** Each `consent.check()` and `check.consent()` cycle creates distinct **Events** that shape the trajectory of the `Relation`.

## üìñ 3. Usage & Application

**Fractal Scaling:** The operator scales from an individual's internal alignment to the foundation of societal contracts.

- **Personal (Micro):** Checking in with all parts of yourself before a major decision. "Am I truly okay with this? I `check.consent()` with my future self."
- **Relational (Meso):** Asking a partner for permission before a vulnerable action or a significant shared decision. "Are you comfortable if I share this with others? I `consent.check()`."
- **Social (Macro):** The process of democratic voting, community governance, or formal contractual agreements between organizations. "The city council `consent.checks()` the new zoning proposal with residents."
- **Global (Meta):** International treaties, terms of service, and data privacy agreements (e.g., GDPR) that require explicit agreement.
- **Universal (Cosmic):** The principle of non-imposition; acting in harmony with universal laws. A self-organizing system `checking.consent()` with its own inherent `Boundedness` before a `transform()` that could cause `Rupture`.

**Canonical Use-Cases:**

- **Mind:** The **internal dialogue of decision-making**, where one part of the mind offers a choice and other parts evaluate its fit with needs and values.
- **Society:** The legal and ethical principle of **Informed Consent** in medicine and research. **OAuth scopes** for API access, **feature flags** with user opt-in, and **cookie consent banners** in technology.
- **Biology:** **Synaptic gating**, which permits or denies signal transmission between neurons based on specific conditions, acting as a `check.consent()` mechanism for neural `Flow`.

**Guardrails:**

- **Non-Coercion by Design (A3):** The `proposal` must be free of pressure, time constraints, or social leverage. The default is always "no." `check.consent()` must ensure the choice is truly free.
- **Granularity:** Be explicit about `scope`, `depth`, `duration`, and `reversibility` in `consent.check()` to reduce `Entropy`.
- **Reversibility:** A clear and safe `return.path()` (`Pillar 4: Descriptors`) must always be available and respected if `consent` is revoked.
- **Record:** For high-stakes `consent`, `loop.close()` should include documentation of the agreed-upon terms to prevent `Entropy` from drift.
- **Separate Acknowledgment from Alignment:** `check.consent()` ensures the proposal is accurately heard *before* evaluating personal alignment.

**Contrast & Comparison:**

- **`coherency.braid()` ‚áÑ `braid.coherency()`:** `consent.check()` is the **invitation to braid paths**. `coherency.braid()` is the **internal engine used to decide on a `check.consent()` request**, testing the proposal against one's entire life-path integrity (`policy_braid`). `check.consent()` might trigger `coherency.braid()` if the proposal is "curious" but requires deeper vetting.
- **`presence.check()` & `readiness.sync()`:** These operators confirm availability and `Capacity`, not permission. They must typically precede a `consent.check()` for optimal `Coherence`.
- **`link()` (K4 Verb):** `link()` is the **general universal verb for creating or weighting a connection**. `consent.check()` is a *specific type* of `link()` operator‚Äîone that establishes a **permissioned `link`** for a proposed `Flow` or `Relation`.

## üí° 4. Notes & Nuances

**Channels of Operation:**

- **Inner:** The internal process of evaluating a proposal against one's own needs, boundaries, and `policy_braid`. This is where `coherency.braid()` is run.
- **Outer:** The direct verbal or written exchange of a `proposal` and its `evaluation` between `Entities`.
- **Mediator:** A neutral third party (e.g., a mediator, a legal system, an automated governance protocol) ensuring fairness, transparency, and adherence to `Guardrails` in the `consent` process.

**Modes of Expression:**

- **Inherent:** The natural inclination to move towards or away from a `Flow` or `Relation` based on felt resonance or dissonance.
- **Apparent:** Explicitly stating, "I `consent.check()` on this proposal," or "The system requires you to `check.consent()` before proceeding."
- **Metaphor:** "Knocking on a door," "offering a bridge," "seeking permission," "drawing a line," "a handshake agreement."

**Further Connections:**

- **Psychological Safety:** Fundamental for creating environments where `Entities` feel secure enough to say "no" without fear of reprisal, fostering `Trust-Reserve`.
- **Systems Governance:** Essential for defining how changes are introduced and approved within any collective `Entity`, ensuring stability and shared ownership.
- **Ethical AI:** Crucial for designing AI systems that respect user agency and privacy, requiring explicit `consent` for data usage or action execution.

**System Notes:**

- `consent.check()` and `check.consent()` are vital operators for maintaining **system `Coherence` and `Trust-Reserve`** by ensuring that all `Flows` and `transformations` are consensual and respectful of `Boundedness`.
- The effectiveness of the `Consent Loop` is highly dependent on the rigor of `check.consent()`'s `evaluation` and the genuine commitment to `Non-Coercion by Design`.
- This operator is a powerful `link()` agent, continuously establishing and managing `Relations` based on explicit agreement, preventing `Entropy` from forced or misaligned actions.
