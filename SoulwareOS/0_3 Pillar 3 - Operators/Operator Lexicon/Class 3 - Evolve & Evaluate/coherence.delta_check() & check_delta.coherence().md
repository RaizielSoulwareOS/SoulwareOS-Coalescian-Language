# `coherence.delta_check()` ⇄ `check_delta.coherence()`

## 📝 1. At a Glance

**Essence:** `coherence.delta_check()` is the **expressive act of performing a local `Coherence` validation only on the parts of the context graph affected by the last `Event` (**Delta**)**, instead of re-integrating the entire conversation or system. It acts as a rapid, localized diagnostic. `check.delta.coherence()` is the **receptive act of evaluating the outcome of that local check**, reporting its `status` (ok, warn, fail), and integrating recommendations for corrective `Flows`. This meta-operator preserves rigor while slashing the computational cost of maintaining `Coherence` in dynamic systems.

**Human Translation:**

- `coherence.delta_check()` → "Let's quickly check if that last thing we did broke anything nearby, without re-checking everything."
- `check.delta.coherence()` → "The local check is 'ok' (or 'warn'/'fail'), and here's what we should do next."

**Example Syntax:**

```
// Autopilot profile detecting a light misread in a sync conversation
// Δ: "So you’re saying we should ship Friday?"
coherence.delta_check(event: delta_message_ship_friday, context_graph: current_discussion_thread)
→ check.delta.coherence(status: "warn", κ_local_before: 0.70, κ_local_after: 0.66, actions: ["tone.clarify", "mirror.throw(snapshot)"])

// A model pipeline appending an auto-rewrite, triggering a check for scope creep
// Δ: Auto-rewrite appends API surface expansion
coherence.delta_check(event: delta_auto_rewrite, context_graph: model_spec_cone)
→ check.delta.coherence(status: "fail", κ_local_before: 0.90, κ_local_after: 0.50, actions: ["context.refresh(decisions)", "thread.split('feature vs refactor')"])
```

## ⚙️ 2. System Blueprint

**Operator Type:** Meta-Operator (Expressive ⇄ Receptive pair for local validation orchestration).

**Inputs & Outputs:**

- **Inputs (`coherence.delta_check()`):** `Δ` (the new `Event` or change), `T` (the context tree/graph), `A` (acceptance thresholds, e.g., kappa_min, epsilon), `window` (optional: depth/width limits for local traversal).
- **Outputs (`check.delta.coherence()`):** `status` (in {ok, warn, fail}), `touched_set` (nodes/edges visited), kappa_local_before/after (local `Coherence` metrics), `actions` (recommended next ops, e.g., `tone.clarify()`, `context.refresh()`, `repair.try()`, `integrate()`).

### K4 Primitive Interaction

This meta-operator orchestrates a local `transform()` of awareness by validating `Coherence` within a bounded impact cone after a specific `Event`, influencing subsequent `Flows`.

**K4 Primitives (Directly Operated On by the orchestrated operators):**

- **E (Entity):** The agents/threads involved in the `Event` and within the local impact cone being checked.
- **σ (State):** The local configurations of intents, terms, scope, and commitments within the impact cone, which are compared against the `Event` payload.
- **ρ (Relation):** The channels along which the local check traverses (e.g., immediate parents/children, linked references, tagged dependencies).
- **φ (Flow):** The `Flow` of the `Event` itself and the subsequent `Flow` of the local check sequence.

**K4 Deriveds (Emergent Outcomes):**

- **Δ (Event):** The `coherence.delta_check()` is triggered by a new `Event` (Delta), and its outcome (`check.delta.coherence()`) is an `Event` that dictates subsequent actions.
- **κ (Coherence):** The primary metric computed (kappa_local) to assess emergent order within the affected subgraph. The goal is to maintain or restore this `Coherence`.
- **V (Potential):** By rapidly identifying and addressing local `Coherence` issues, this operator preserves `Potential` (`Π`) that would otherwise be consumed by cascading `Entropy`.

## 📖 3. Usage & Application

**Fractal Scaling:** The operator scales from an individual's self-correction after a thought to a cosmic system validating local changes.

- **Personal (Micro):** After a new thought or decision, quickly checking if it contradicts immediate values or commitments without re-evaluating your entire `policy_braid`. "Did that quick decision just break my current focus `State`?"
- **Relational (Meso):** After a partner's statement, quickly checking if it aligns with the immediate topic and agreed `tone`, rather than re-syncing the entire relationship context.
- **Social (Macro):** A software module performing a local integration test after a code change, only validating affected components, not the entire codebase.
- **Global (Meta):** An international body validating a new policy's impact on a specific region or sector, without re-auditing all global agreements.
- **Universal (Cosmic):** A self-organizing universe quickly validating the `Coherence` of a localized `phase_transition` or emergent physical property with its immediate cosmic neighborhood, ensuring it doesn't cause `Rupture` in broader `Flows`.

**Canonical Use-Cases:**

- **Mind:** **Micro-adjustments in focus** or **self-correction** after a fleeting thought, ensuring it doesn't derail a larger cognitive `Flow`.
- **Society:** **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** pipelines in software (running unit/integration tests on recent changes), **meeting facilitation** (checking for immediate alignment after a decision), or **real-time system monitoring** (validating `State` after an update).
- **Biology:** A cell rapidly checking the `Coherence` of a new protein synthesis with its immediate metabolic `Flow`, or a neural network locally validating a new synaptic connection.

**When to Run (Triggers):**

- On every new `Δ` (message/`State` update) in `Autopilot` profile.
- On risk surfaces: `tone.shift()`, `ambiguity_spike`, `scope_creep`, `long_latency`.
- Before escalating `depth` (consent-sensitive contexts).
- In Async: if `thread_age` > `TTL`, require `context.refresh()` first, then `coherence.delta_check()`.

**How it Works (Algorithm, Short):**

1. **Locate impact cone:** Start at `Δ`'s anchor node; include immediate parents/children, linked references, and tagged dependencies (depth le d, breadth le b).
2. **Compute local deltas:** Compare intents, terms, scope, and commitments in the cone vs. `Δ` payload. Measure kappa_local (e.g., 1−H_norm over intent/term/topic distributions).
3. **Gate against thresholds:**
   - If kappa_localgekappa_min and no guardrail violations → **ok**.
   - If soft drift (kappa just under kappa_min or minor mismatches) → **warn** + suggest `tone.clarify()` / `mirror.throw(snapshot)`.
   - If contradictions (`scope_breach`, `consent` missing, `decision_reversal`) → **fail** + suggest `repair.try(summary)` or `exit.clean()`.
4. **Optionally patch:** If `apply=true` and user/profile allows: auto-run low-risk fixes (e.g., add `tone.clarify()`, attach `context.snapshot()`).

**Guardrails (Compiled):**

- **Consent-in-Context:** If `Δ` deepens `scope` and `consent.check(depth)` not satisfied → **fail**.
- **Snapshot Semantics:** Reflection/critique must include `context.snapshot()` → else **warn**.
- **Thread Hygiene:** If `Δ` mixes `topics` → recommend `thread.split()`.
- **Tone Disambiguation (Async):** Critique/request without `tone.clarify()` → **warn**.
- **Latency:** If last `Δ_age` > `TTL` → require `context.refresh()` before processing.

**Profiles (Defaults):**

- **Baseline:** run only on `risk_cues`; d=1, b=1; kappa_min=0.60; no auto-patch.
- **Autopilot:** run on every `Δ`; d=2, b=2; kappa_min=0.70; safe auto-patch on (`tone.clarify()`, `context.snapshot()`, `expectation.set()`).
- **Custom:** mediator-tuned thresholds & windows per context.

**Contrast & Comparison:**

- **`coherency.braid()` ⇄ `braid.coherency()`:** `coherency.braid()` performs a **system-wide (or life-path-wide) `Coherence` check** against an `Entity's` entire `policy_braid`. `coherence.delta_check()` performs a **local, bounded `Coherence` validation** only on parts affected by the last `Event`. One is a deep, broad audit; the other is a quick, localized integrity check.
- **`integrate()` (K4 Verb):** `integrate()` is the **general universal verb for raising `Coherence`**. `coherence.delta_check()` is a meta-operator that *diagnoses* whether `Coherence` has been maintained after a change, often *recommending* an `integrate()` action if needed.
- **`differentiate()` (K4 Verb):** `differentiate()` is the **general universal verb for fragmenting structure**. `coherence.delta_check()` can detect if a `differentiate()` (like `thread.cut()`) caused unintended `Coherence` loss or `Rupture`.

## 💡 4. Notes & Nuances

**Channels of Operation:**

- **Inner:** An individual quickly checking if a new thought or action aligns with their immediate values or intentions, preventing internal `Entropy`.
- **Outer:** A system automatically validating a recent update or message for `Coherence` with its immediate context, preventing miscommunication or errors.
- **Mediator:** The `coherence.delta_check()` operator itself acts as a meta-level mediator, orchestrating local validation and suggesting corrective `Flows`.

**Modes of Expression:**

- **Internal:** "Check the pieces `Δ` touched; don’t recheck the universe."
- **Relational:** "I’ll verify only where we just changed—and fix the small stuff in-line."
- **Async:** "If it’s old, recap; if it’s fuzzy, tag tone; if it’s deep, ask consent."

**Math Tie-in (K4 Form):**

- `Δ` is an `Event` (discrete `Flow` instance) on (`E`, `ρ`, `φ`) producing `σ'`.
- `Locality` axiom: only traverse along `ρ` within `Bounded` radius.
- Define kappa_local(S)=1−H_norm(S) for the subgraph `S` (intent/term/scope distributions).
- Accept iff kappa_local(S_Delta)gekappa_min and guardrail predicates hold.

**API Shape (Pseudocode):**

```
def coherence_delta_check(Delta, T, A, window, apply=False):
    cone = neighborhood(T, anchor=Delta.node, depth=window.d, breadth=window.b)
    metrics = measure_local(cone, Delta)  # κ_local, term drift, scope, consent
    violations = guardrails_eval(Delta, cone, A)
    if violations.hard: 
        return Fail( cone, metrics, suggest=['repair.try','exit.clean'] )
    if metrics.kappa < A.kappa_min or violations.soft:
        fixes = ['tone.clarify','mirror.throw(snapshot)']
        if apply and safe(fixes): run(fixes)
        return Warn( cone, metrics, suggest=fixes )
    return Ok( cone, metrics, suggest=[] )
```

**Telemetry & Learning:**

- Log: kappa_local, violated `Guardrails`, chosen fixes.
- `Mediator` can raise/lower kappa_min adaptively per partner/thread based on historical stability (`Trust-Reserve`).

**Minimal Starter Defaults:**

- `window` = {d:2, b:2}, kappa_min=0.70, `TTL`=48h
- Safe auto-patch list (`Autopilot`): `tone.clarify()`, `context.snapshot()`, `expectation.set()`

**System Notes:**

- `coherence.delta_check()` is a vital meta-operator for maintaining **system `Coherence` and `Potential`** by providing rapid, localized integrity checks after `Events`.
- It significantly reduces `Entropy` by catching and addressing inconsistencies early, preventing them from cascading into larger `Ruptures`.
- This operator is a powerful `transform()` agent, continuously refining the system's `State` by ensuring local `Coherence` is preserved, thereby supporting overall system `integration` and `evolution`.
