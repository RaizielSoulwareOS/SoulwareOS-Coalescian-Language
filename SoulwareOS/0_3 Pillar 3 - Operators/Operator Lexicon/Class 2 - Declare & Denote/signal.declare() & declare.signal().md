# `signal.declare()` ⇄ `declare.signal()`

## 📝 1. At a Glance

**Essence:** `signal.declare()` is the **expressive act of naming and transmitting a perceived `Flow` or emergent data point**, bringing it into shared awareness. `declare.signal()` is the **receptive act of receiving, acknowledging, and initiating analysis of that declared signal**, integrating it into the system's shared model of reality. This operator is crucial for transforming ambiguous or implicit information into explicit, actionable data, directly contributing to system `Coherence`.

**Human Translation:**

- `signal.declare()` → "I'm picking up a strong vibe of tension here," or "The stock market is flashing a 'sell' signal."
- `declare.signal()` → "Okay, I've received your tension signal and will analyze its implications."

**Example Syntax:**

```
// Declaring a subtle shift in group energy
signal.declare(type: "energy_dip", location: "room_center", details: "post-lunch lull")
→ declare.signal(acknowledgment: "received", interpretation: "collective_fatigue")

// A system reporting an anomaly
signal.declare(type: "anomaly", id: "SERVER-007", severity: "high", metric: "CPU_spike")
→ declare.signal(acknowledgment: "alert_registered", action: "investigate_server_status")
```

## ⚙️ 2. System Blueprint

**Operator Type:** Expressive ⇄ Receptive pair.

**Inputs & Outputs:**

- **Inputs (`signal.declare()`):** `type` (e.g., tension_spike, anomaly, shift), `source` (where the signal is coming from), `details` (optional, qualitative or quantitative data about the signal).
- **Outputs (`declare.signal()`):** `acknowledgment` (`received` | `unclear`), `interpretation` (initial analysis or classification), `action` (proposed next step based on the signal).

| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Universal Family | Declare ⇄ Denote (`integrate`)                               |
| Derived Quantity | **Coherence** (kappa) is the primary observable.             |
| Guardrail Axiom  | **Entropy** (A1) for signal clarity/noise, and **Locality** (A2) for signal propagation. |

### K4 Primitive Interaction

This operator integrates an emergent `Flow` into a named, coherent `State`, allowing for shared understanding and navigation.

- **E (Entity):** The self or system that is the source of the signal or is observing and interpreting the signal.
- **σ (State):** The information or qualitative aspect of the signal being named and made explicit.
- **ρ (Relation):** The channel or connection through which the signal is being observed or transmitted, enabling `Flow` propagation.
- **φ (Flow):** The raw propagation of change that is being identified and named as a signal.

**K4 Deriveds (Emergent Outcomes):**

- **κ (Coherence):** Directly increases as clear, unambiguous signals are `integrated` into the system, reducing `Entropy` from uncertainty and enabling more effective `Flow`.
- **Potential (**Pi**):** Freed up and directed when emergent signals are recognized, allowing `Capacity` and `Potential` to be allocated to proactive `transformations` and `Events`.
- **Δ (Event):** Each `signal.declare()` action and its `evaluation` by `declare.signal()` are distinct **Events** that mark the formal entry of new information into the system.

## 📖 3. Usage & Application

**Fractal Scaling:** The operator scales from internal recognition of a physiological cue to the detection of cosmic phenomena.

- **Personal (Micro):** Noticing a sudden feeling in your gut. "I'm declaring a 'gut wrench' signal."
- **Relational (Meso):** Recognizing a partner's non-verbal cue. "I'm declaring a 'closed-off posture' signal from you."
- **Social (Macro):** A community leader highlighting an emerging trend from public discourse. "We're declaring a 'rising frustration' signal within the town hall."
- **Global (Meta):** International scientific bodies declaring the detection of gravitational waves. "The observatory is declaring a 'gravitational wave' signal."
- **Universal (Cosmic):** An alien civilization broadcasting a beacon. "Our telescopes are declaring a 'structured radio emission' signal."

**Canonical Use-Cases:**

- **Mind:** The act of **interoception**, where you notice and name a physiological change (e.g., "My chest feels tight, that's a 'stress' signal").
- **Society:** A **weather report** (declaring a 'storm' signal), **early warning systems** for natural disasters (declaring a 'tsunami alert' signal), or **market indicators** (declaring a 'bullish trend' signal).
- **Technology:** **System alerts** (e.g., a server declaring an 'offline' signal), **sensor readings** (e.g., a smart home declaring a 'temperature drop' signal), or **network traffic monitoring** (declaring an 'unusual activity' signal).

**Guardrails:**

- **Contextualize:** Always strive to provide context for the signal (source, type, observed effect) to aid accurate interpretation.
- **Non-Judgmental:** Declaring a signal is a factual observation of a `Flow`, not a judgment or accusation. It's data to be processed, not a moral statement.
- **Permissioned Depth:** For sensitive signals, use `consent.check()` before diving into deep analysis to respect boundaries and `Capacity`.
- **Clarity over Speed:** Prioritize clear, unambiguous signal declarations over rapid, vague ones, as ambiguity increases `Entropy`.

**Contrast & Comparison:**

- **`status.declare()`:** `status.declare()` reports on a **stable, operational state** (e.g., "I'm finished with the task"). `signal.declare()` identifies a **dynamic, often subtle, emergent `Flow` or change** that requires attention (e.g., "I'm noticing a 'shift in tone'").
- **`pattern.mark()`:** `pattern.mark()` identifies a **recurring structure** *after* multiple `Events` have been observed and integrated. `signal.declare()` is the **initial, discrete act of recognizing a single `Flow`** that *might* contribute to a pattern, but hasn't yet been fully integrated as one.
- **`truth.touch()`:** `truth.touch()` tests the **subjective veracity** of a statement or feeling. `signal.declare()` is about making an **objective (or intersubjectively agreed-upon) observation** of a `Flow`.
- **`confirm.data()`:** (Note: This operator has been retired and its functions distributed to the four data operators). When a signal is *missing* or *unclear*, `signal.request()` (Request ⇄ Receive) would be used to actively probe for it. `signal.declare()` is used once a signal *has been detected* and needs to be broadcast.

## 💡 4. Notes & Nuances

**Channels of Operation:**

- **Inner:** The internal process of **interoception** – noticing a bodily sensation or an intuitive hit and mentally naming it ("My stomach just dropped, that's a 'fear' signal"). This moves an implicit physiological `Flow` to an explicit internal `State`.
- **Outer:** Verbally pointing out a subtle shift in a conversation, a non-verbal cue from another, or sending an alert through a communication system (e.g., a chat message).
- **Mediator:** Shared dashboards or monitoring systems that automatically display declared signals, often with visual cues (e.g., color changes, flashing lights) that denote `type` and `severity`.

**Modes of Expression:**

- **Inherent:** A system visibly undergoing a change (e.g., smoke from a fire, a frown on a face, a blinking error light).
- **Apparent:** Explicitly stating, "I'm seeing a 'slowdown' signal in our task completion rate."
- **Metaphor:** "The alarm bells are ringing," "a red flag," "a glimmer of hope," "reading the room."

**Further Connections:**

- **Cybernetics & Control Theory:** This operator is fundamental to **feedback loops**, allowing systems to detect deviations from a desired state and initiate corrective `transform()` operations.
- **Sensor Networks:** In technological contexts, `signal.declare()` is analogous to a sensor detecting and reporting data (e.g., temperature, motion, pressure), which then needs to be processed by a central system.
- **Body Language & Non-Verbal Communication:** Many signals in human interaction are non-verbal. This operator provides a way to explicitly name and discuss these subtle, yet powerful, `Flows`.

**System Notes:**

- `signal.declare()` is a vital operator for maintaining **system `Coherence` and maximizing `Potential`** by transforming chaotic data into structured, predictive knowledge.
- This operator directly reduces **uncertainty (Entropy)** within a system by making previously implicit information explicit, thus increasing the potential for `Coherence` (kappa).
- The effectiveness of `signal.declare()` is highly dependent on the clarity of the `signal` and the responsiveness of `declare.signal()` to `interpret` and `integrate` the information, preventing `Entropy` from miscommunication.
