# Pillar 3: Operators (The Verbs of Action)

---

## Introduction: The Tools for Navigation

The **Operators** are the _"verbs"_ of SoulwareOS.  
They are the functional, executable tools that allow a user to navigate their inner world and the shared space of a relationship.

Each operator is a **specific, well-defined action** that can be used to:
- Check a state
- Initiate a change
- Maintain coherence

> **Naming and using an Operator is how intention becomes action in SoulwareOS.**

This pillar provides the **master list of all core operators** in SoulwareOS.  
They are grouped into **8 primary classes** based on their function.
