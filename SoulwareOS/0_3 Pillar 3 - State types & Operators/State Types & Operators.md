## Pillar 3: State Types & Operator Map

## Introduction

Every meaningful move in Soulware is built from a small set of irreducible “primitives” drawn from K4:

- **Entity (E)**: Who/what is acting or sensed
- **State (σ)**: The system’s condition
- **Relation (ρ)**: How entities connect
- **Flow (φ)**: The process or movement between and within
- **Meta (meta)**: Reflections, guides, upgrades

Here, all **recognized state types and operators** are mapped to these primitives, so anyone can see how every pattern, role, or protocol sits within the universal grammar.

## Section 1: State Types & Their K4 Roots

| State Type (“Noun”) | K4 Primitive          | Notes                                        |
| :------------------ | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| presence            | Entity (E)            | Participating self                           |
| stance              | Entity (E)            | Position, posture, viewpoint                 |
| readiness           | State (σ)             | Preparedness, activation                     |
| energy              | State (σ)             | Capacity, potential, arousal                 |
| intent              | State (σ)             | Purpose or desire                            |
| trust_reserve       | State (σ)             | Buffer of risk tolerance                     |
| context             | Relation (ρ)          | Shared frame or story                        |
| thread              | Relation (ρ)          | Sustained communication or attention channel |
| consent             | Relation (ρ)          | Relational permission                        |
| tempo               | Flow (φ)              | Pace, timing                                 |
| loop                | Flow (φ)              | Repeatable sequence, arc                     |
| repair              | Flow (φ)              | Processes of restoration                     |
| meaning             | State/Flow            | Value, sense made (sometimes hybrid)         |
| bias                | State (σ)             | Skew, tilt, or prior tendency                |
| boundary            | Entity/Relation (E/ρ) | Limit, edge, or constraint                   |

(Add as needed—always map each to a K4 root for transparency and clarity)

## 2. Operator Map by Action Family

| Operator         | K4 Family       | Expressive Syntax | Receptive Syntax | Brief Description             |
| :--------------- | :-------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------- |
| presence.check() | link()          | presence.check()  | check.presence() | Test or establish a channel   |
| consent.ask()    | link()          | consent.ask()     | ask.consent()    | Request or process permission |
| stance.declare() | integrate()     | stance.declare()  | declare.stance() | Share/receive position        |
| boundary.hold()  | integrate()     | boundary.hold()   | hold.boundary()  | Set/acknowledge boundary      |
| repair.try()     | transform()     | repair.try()      | try.repair()     | Attempt/propose repair        |
| tempo.adjust()   | transform()     | tempo.adjust()    | adjust.tempo()   | Move pace up/down             |
| loop.close()     | differentiate() | loop.close()      | close.loop()     | End or accept a loop          |
| thread.cut()     | differentiate() | thread.cut()      | cut.thread()     | Break/split a channel         |
| intent.verify()  | transform()     | intent.verify()   | verify.intent()  | Confirm intent alignment      |
| reset.point()    | differentiate() | reset.point()     | point.reset()    | Reset to breakpoint           |
| meta.reflect()   | meta            | meta.reflect()    | reflect.meta()   | Audit from the outside        |

(Continue for all canon and somantic-specific operators)

## 3. The Operator Mirror Rule

**Mirror Rule Principle:**
Every operator in Soulware is defined by its polarity—a move is only complete when it can be both expressed and received (mirrored).

- **Expressive:** Acts from agent (`boundary.hold()`, `presence.check()`)
- **Receptive:** Acts upon or processes incoming move (`hold.boundary()`, `check.presence()`)

**Why mirror?**

- Ensures transparency of process and agency.
- Guarantees that protocol state is visible and auditable for all participants.
- Creates opportunity for witnessing, repair, or extension at every layer.

**Examples:**

| Expressive          | Receptive          | Use Case / Bridge                                            |
| :------------------ | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `energy.deplete()`  | `deplete.energy()` | Body signals low energy; protocol acknowledges recovery needed |
| `presence.check()`  | `check.presence()` | One signals readiness, other confirms                        |
| `consent.ask()`     | `ask.consent()`    | Request is matched by permission response                    |
| Any immune operator | (see immune map)   | Both detection and memory of threat/state                    |

*If proposing a new state or operator, always define its mirror or receiving form!*

## 4. How to Extend or Propose

- Identify the K4 primitive or combination.
- State clear, single-function purpose (no “blend” or ambiguity).
- Write both expressive and receptive syntaxes (“mirror”).
- Add plain-language use case.
- Align with a K4 family (link/integrate/transform/differentiate/meta).
- Share to the community for review, feedback, and audit.

## Closing

This reference map ensures **all language and moves remain universally compatible, extensible, and clear**—so protocols and somantic ladders can always scale, upgrade, or localize without drift or confusion.
