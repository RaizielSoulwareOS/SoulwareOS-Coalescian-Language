## Pillar 3: State Types & Operator Map

## Introduction

Every meaningful move in Soulware is built from a small set of irreducible “primitives” drawn from K4:

- **Entity (E)**: Who/what is acting or sensed
- **State (σ)**: The system’s condition
- **Relation (ρ)**: How entities connect
- **Flow (φ)**: The process or movement between and within
- **Meta (meta)**: Reflections, guides, upgrades

Here, all **recognized state types and operators** are mapped to these primitives, so anyone can see how every pattern, role, or protocol sits within the universal grammar.
