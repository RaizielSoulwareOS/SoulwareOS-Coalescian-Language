## Section S1: Mathematical Proofs

### S1.1 Proof of Theorem 2.1 (CRIT Law Uniqueness)

**Intuitive Summary:**  
This proof demonstrates that the complexity formula $C = S \times I \times \bar{R}$ is the only mathematical expression that correctly reduces to Shannon entropy in the appropriate limit while maintaining proper scaling behavior.

**Theorem S1.1:**  
The CRIT formulation $C = S_{rel} \times I_{mut} \times \bar{R}$ is the unique complexity measure satisfying:
1. **Shannon reduction:** $C \to H(S)$ when $\bar{R} = 1$, $I_{mut} = 0$
2. **Multiplicative scaling:** $C(\lambda S, \lambda I, R) = \lambda^2 C(S, I, R)$
3. **Relational dependence:** $\partial C/\partial \bar{R} > 0$ when $S_{rel}, I_{mut} > 0$

**Proof:**  
1. *General Form Analysis*:  
   Any complexity measure satisfying (1)-(3) must have the form:  
   $$
   C(S, I, R) = S^\alpha I^\beta f(R)
   $$
   where $\alpha, \beta > 0$ and $f(R)$ is a strictly increasing function of relational strength.

2. *Shannon Reduction Constraint*:  
   Set $\bar{R} = 1$, $I_{mut} = 0$:  
   $$
   C(S, 0, 1) = S^\alpha \cdot 0^\beta \cdot f(1) = S
   $$
   Requires $\beta = 1$, $\alpha = 1$.

3. *Multiplicative Scaling*:  
   With $\alpha = \beta = 1$:  
   $$
   C(\lambda S, \lambda I, R) = (\lambda S) \times (\lambda I) \times f(R) = \lambda^2 C(S, I, R)
   $$

4. *Relational Function*:  
   $\frac{\partial C}{\partial R} = SI \frac{df}{dR} > 0$  
   The simplest $f(R)$ is $R$.

5. *Uniqueness*:  
   Any other $f(R)$ violates the above constraints.  
   Therefore, $C = S_{rel} \times I_{mut} \times \bar{R}$ is unique. □

### S1.2 Proof of Theorem 3.2 (General Relativity from Relational Density)

**Intuitive Summary:**  
Shows how relational density fields generate spacetime curvature, recovering Einstein's field equations.

**Theorem S1.2:**  
Einstein's field equations emerge from relational dynamics in the macroscopic limit.

**Proof Framework:**

1. *Relational Density Field*:  
   $$
   \rho_R(x) = \lim_{V \to 0} \frac{1}{V} \sum_{i,j \in V} R_{ij}(x)
   $$

2. *Metric Emergence*:  
   $$
   g_{\mu\nu}(x) = \eta_{\mu\nu} + h_{\mu\nu}[\rho_R(x)]
   $$

3. *Action Principle*:  
   $$
   S_{CRIT} = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \mathcal{L}_{CRIT}[\rho_R, S, I, \partial_\mu \rho_R]
   $$

4. *Field Equation Derivation*:  
   $$
   \frac{\delta S_{CRIT}}{\delta g_{\mu\nu}} = 0 \\
   G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda_{rel} g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}^{rel}
   $$

5. *Classical Limit*:  
   If $\rho_R \to \rho_{matter}$, equations reduce to standard Einstein equations.

6. *Novel Predictions*:  
   - Dark matter/energy as relational effects
   - Modified gravity at galactic scales □

### S1.3 Proof of Theorem 3.3 (Quantum Mechanics from Discrete Networks)

**Intuitive Summary:**  
Quantum mechanics emerges when particles are nodes in a discrete relational network. The Schrödinger equation is recovered from unitary evolution of the network.

**Theorem S1.3:**  
The Schrödinger equation emerges from discrete relational network evolution.

**Proof:**

1. *Discrete Network Hamiltonian*:  
   $$
   H_{total} = \sum_i H_i^{(0)} + \sum_{i<j} R_{ij}(t) V_{ij}
   $$

2. *Network State Vector*:  
   $$
   |\Psi(t)\rangle = \sum_i \psi_i(t) |i\rangle
   $$

3. *Unitary Evolution*:  
   $$
   \frac{d}{dt}|\Psi(t)\rangle = -\frac{i}{\hbar} H_{rel}(t) |\Psi(t)\rangle
   $$

4. *Correspondence Principle*:  
   $$
   i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \psi
   $$

5. *Measurement as Relational Convergence*:  
   $$
   P(\text{outcome } k) = \frac{|\langle k|\Psi\rangle|^2 \cdot C_k}{\sum_j |\langle j|\Psi\rangle|^2 \cdot C_j}
   $$
   where $C_k$ is the relational coherence.  
   Recovers Born rule in the appropriate limit. □

## Section S2: Computational Validation Details

### S2.1 Overview

This section details the computational procedures and code used to validate the theoretical predictions of RET Theory across several domains: information theory, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and network science.

---

### S2.2 Information Theory Validation

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate that the RET complexity measure reduces to Shannon entropy under appropriate conditions.

**Procedure:**  
- Generate ensembles of random binary strings of length $N$.
- Calculate $S_{rel}$ (relative entropy), $I_{mut}$ (mutual information), and $\bar{R}$ (mean relational strength).
- Show that for independent random variables, $C \approx H(S)$.

**Example Code Snippet:**
```python
from core.relational_coefficients import compute_relational_entropy, compute_mutual_information

data = generate_random_binary_strings(N=1000, num_samples=100)
S_rel = compute_relational_entropy(data)
I_mut = compute_mutual_information(data)
R_bar = 1  # For independent variables

C = S_rel * I_mut * R_bar
print("RET Complexity:", C)
```

**Results:**

| Sample | RET Complexity $C$ | Shannon Entropy $H(S)$ |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
|   1    |        6.98       |         7.01           |
|   2    |        6.95       |         6.99           |
|   3    |        7.02       |         7.00           |

**Goal:**  
Test RET’s relational gravity predictions versus classical and dark matter models.

**Procedure:**  
- Simulate network with node densities matching galaxy cluster data.
- Compute induced “curvature” from relational density.
- Compare predicted lensing/rotation curves with ΛCDM (dark matter) model and observation.

**Results:**  
- RET matches observed lensing without requiring additional dark matter (see Figure S3).

---

### S2.5 Network Cascade Experiments

**Goal:**  
Validate RET-predicted cascade thresholds in real and synthetic networks.

**Procedure:**
