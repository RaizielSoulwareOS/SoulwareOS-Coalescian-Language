# Relational Emergence Theory (RET): A Unified Framework

## Abstract

This paper presents Relational Emergence Theory - a conceptual framework proposing that physical reality emerges from patterns of energy interaction rather than from discrete entities. RET offers intuitive explanations for quantum measurement, spacetime structure, and complex systems while maintaining mathematical compatibility with established physics. We present this as theoretical speculation aimed at resolving persistent conceptual puzzles in modern physics.
