**RET Theory** (Relational Emergence Theory) proposes a unified mathematical and computational framework for understanding how complexity, information, and structure emerge from networks of relations. Bridging concepts from information theory, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and network science, RET offers new tools and predictions for the study of complex systems, consciousness, physics, and beyond.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Unified Complexity Measure:** Formal proof that $C = S_{rel} \times I_{mut} \times \bar{R}$ is the unique, physically meaningful complexity metric, reducing to Shannon entropy in the appropriate limit.
- **Relational Gravity:** Shows how spacetime curvature and Einstein‚Äôs field equations emerge from patterns of relational density, not just matter.
- **Quantum Emergence:** Derives the Schr√∂dinger equation and quantum measurement from network evolution rules, with testable deviations from standard quantum mechanics.
- **Computational Validation:** Includes code and protocols for empirical tests across social, biological, and technological networks.
- **Open Science:** All proofs, data, code, and experimental protocols are available for replication and extension.
