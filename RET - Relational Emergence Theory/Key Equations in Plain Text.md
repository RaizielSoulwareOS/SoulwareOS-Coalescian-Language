## 6. RET Lensing Prediction (Simplified)

**Formula:**  
theta_RET = (4G / c^2) × (M_rel / b)

**Where:**  
- theta_RET = RET-predicted gravitational lensing angle  
- G = gravitational constant  
- c = speed of light  
- M_rel = effective relational mass

## 7. Mutual Information

**Formula:**  
I = sum over i,j of [ P(i, j) × log2( P(i, j) / (P(i) × P(j)) ) ]

**Where:**
