# Universal Kernel (K4)

## Soulware™ v1.0

### An Operating System for Human Meaning

## Primitives (what exists)

1. **Entity** `E` — any system/agent/process.
2. **State** `σ(E)` — the current configuration of an entity.
3. **Relation** `ρ(Ei,Ej)` — a channel by which change can propagate.
4. **Flow** `φ` — propagation of change across relations over a cut of the system.

Works for physics, biology, minds, AIs, cultures.


## Axioms (non-optional rules)

A1. **Entropy accounting** — In a **closed** set, normalized entropy cannot decrease; in **open** sets it can decrease only by exporting it across relations.
A2. **Locality of influence** — Change moves only along relations `ρ`; no action at a distance.
A3. **Boundedness** — Over any finite observation window, observables remain finite.
A4. **Compositionality** — Entities and relations compose: you can form supersystems; flows respect composition.

These four are universal and minimal. Everything else is derivable.


## Operators (verbs that do work)

O1. **Link** `(Ei, Ej, w)` → define/weight a relation `ρ`.
O2. **Transform** `(E, f)` → update state: `σ ← f(σ, inputs)`.
O3. **Integrate** `I(S)` → compute/raise a **coherence** order parameter `κ(S) = 1 − H_norm(S)`.
O4. **Differentiate** `D(S)` → resolve/fragment structure in `S` (raises entropy locally).

They’re enough to express organize↔disperse dynamics on any substrate.


## Derived quantities (not axioms, just useful)

* **Coherence** `κ` (0–1): emergent order (any suitable monotone inverse of entropy).
* **Potential** `Π`: free capacity to reduce local entropy by exporting it (from A1).
* **Capacity** `C`: bounded work you can perform before violating A3.
* **Event** `Δ`: a discrete, countable instance of change.
