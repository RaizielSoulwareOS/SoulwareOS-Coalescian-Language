# K4 ↔ Temporal Module (Plug-in Spec)

## 1) Kernel alignment (who-is-who)

| K4 primitive            | Temporal view                  | Notes                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity `E`**          | the carrier of a timeline      | A person, team, codebase, org, system.        |
| **State `σ(E)`**        | **`time.now(E)`**              | The current snapshot of E.                    |
| **Relation `ρ(Ei,Ej)`** | **`time.sync(Ei,Ej)`** channel | A coupling that can align or drift timelines. |
| **Flow `φ`**            | **Δ-sequenced change**         | Each event **`Δ`** advances `σ` → `σ’`.       |

> Minimal extension: add a **discrete event counter** `Δ ∈ ℕ` (logical clock). No global t.

------

## 2) Axioms (temporalized)

- **A1 Entropy accounting.** Over any window of events `{Δ_k…Δ_{k+n}}`, normalized entropy of a *closed* E cannot decrease; in *open* E it can decrease only by exporting it via `ρ`.
   *Temporal reading:* you can *tidy your past* only by paying for it in the present/future (work, attention) or by externalizing load.
- **A2 Locality of influence.** Change moves along existing relations `ρ`.
   *Temporal reading:* your future is reachable only through sequences you actually run (no time teleports).
- **A3 Boundedness.** Over any finite run of events, observables remain finite.
   *Temporal reading:* memories, logs, threads must be finite per window; avoid “infinite past dredge” ops.
- **A4 Compositionality.** Entities/relations compose; flows respect composition.
   *Temporal reading:* personal threads compose into team timelines; team timelines compose into org history.

## 3) Operators: kernel verbs with time

| Kernel verb            | Temporal specialization             | Signature                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **`link(Ei,Ej,w)`**    | establish/weight a **sync channel** | `time.sync.open(Ei,Ej, w, policy)`               |
| **`transform(E,f)`**   | advance one event                   | `advance(E, f): σ_{n+1} ← f(σ_n, inputs); Δ++`   |
| **`integrate(S)`**     | consolidate over a window           | `time.integrate(S, window=[n−k..n]) → κ`         |
| **`differentiate(S)`** | split/relabel threads               | `time.split(S, criterion)` or `time.cut(reason)` |

> All Temporal Module ops (e.g., `time.hold`, `time.meet`, `time.seed`) compile to these four.

------

## 4) Temporal ops → kernel lowers

- **`time.hold()`** → `integrate({σ_now})` to stabilize κ locally (no new Δ).
- **`time.meet(past_state)`** → `integrate({σ_now, σ_{n−k}})` with repair.try if mismatch.
- **`time.seed(future_flow)`** → `transform(E, f_seed)` + `seed.marker(Δ+τ_hint)`.
- **`time.thread(id)`** → maintain a named sequence `{Δ_i}` with metadata.
- **`time.cut(reason)`** → `differentiate(S)` (hard split) + `close.loop(hard)`.
- **`time.loop(detect)`** → pattern match on `{σ_{n−p..n}}`; if true → `repair.try(summary)` or `frame.shift()`.
- **`time.sync(other)`** → `link(E, other, w)` + policy: conflict-resolution, lag bounds.

------

## 5) Guardrails (formal)

- **Temporal consent.** `require consent.check(depth, range=[n−k..n+m])` before referencing another’s past/future.
- **Delta integrity.** `∀Δ: size(Δ)<∞` and `Δ` increments exactly once per `transform`.
- **Latency bound.** If `age(thread) > L`, enforce `context.refresh()` before any depth op.
- **No coercive futures.** `time.seed()` MUST scope to self; cross-entity futures require `goal.align()`.

------

## 6) Metrics you can actually compute

- **Coherence over window:**
   `κ_window = 1 − H_norm({σ_{n−k}..σ_n})`
   (how consistent the narrative is across k steps)
- **Drift between entities:**
   `drift(Ei,Ej) = distance(trace_i, trace_j)`
   (e.g., edit-distance on decisions; lag on milestones)
- **Loopiness score:**
   `loop(E) = recurrence({σ_{n−p}..σ_n})`
   (flags rumination / repeating failure modes)
- **Lead bias (future load):**
   `lead(E) = |planned Δ| / capacity(E)`
   (over-commit protection)

------

## 7) Tiny spec: async envelope as Δ-aware

- **readiness.check(window)** → schedule a **Δ window** for response, not a wall-clock hour.
- **context.refresh()** → include `{snapshot(σ_{n−k}), decisions, next Δ}`.
- **close.loop(type)** → log terminal Δ for the thread with reason.

------

## 8) Worked micro-examples

**Self repair (past integration)**

```
time.meet(σ_{n−3})       # recall exact past state
mirror.throw(snapshot)   # verify meaning of that step
repair.try(summary)      # integrate discrepancy
advance(E, f_reframe)    # produce σ_{n+1}; Δ++
```

**Team alignment (future sync)**

```
time.sync.open(A,B,w,policy=“consensus-or-park”)
context.refresh({summary, nextΔ: “spec freeze”})
goal.align(M3)           # shared milestone at Δ+k
seed.marker(Δ+k, “review”)
```

**Stop a rumination loop**

```
if time.loop(detect, window=7):
  frame.shift()
  time.hold()
  expectation.set(“revisit after Δ+2”)
```
