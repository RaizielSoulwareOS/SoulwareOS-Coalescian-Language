# Universal Kernel (K4)

### An Operating System for Human Meaning

## Primitives (What Exists)

1. Entity `E` — Any system, agent, or process.
2. State `σ(E)` — The current configuration of an entity.
3. Relation `ρ(Ei, Ej)` — A channel by which change can propagate.
4. Flow `φ` — Propagation of change across relations over a cut of the system.

> Works for physics, biology, minds, AIs, cultures.

## Axioms (Non-Optional Rules)

A1. Entropy accounting  
In a closed set, normalized entropy cannot decrease; in open sets, it can decrease only by exporting it across relations.

A2. Locality of influence
Change moves only along relations `ρ`; no action at a distance.

A3. Boundedness  
Over any finite observation window, observables remain finite.

A4. Compositionality
Entities and relations compose: you can form supersystems; flows respect composition.

> These four are universal and minimal. Everything else is derivable.

## Operators (Verbs That Do Work)

- O1. link `(Ei, Ej, w)`  
  Define or weight a relation `ρ`.
- O2. transform `(E, f)`  
  Update state: `σ ← f(σ, inputs)`.
- O3. integrate `(S)`  
  Compute/raise a **coherence** order parameter: `κ(S) = 1 − H_norm(S)`.
- O4. differentiate `(S)`  
  Resolve/fragment structure in `S` (raises entropy locally).

> Keep just these four—they’re enough to express organize↔disperse dynamics on any substrate.

## Derived Quantities (Not Axioms, Just Useful)

- Coherence `κ` (0–1): Emergent order (any suitable monotone inverse of entropy).
- Potential `Π`: Free capacity to reduce local entropy by exporting it (from A1).
- Capacity `C`: Bounded work you can perform before violating A3.
- Event `Δ`: A discrete, countable instance of change.
